Homework: Hello, iOS!
Create a scaffolded-out iOS application

use the organization identifier "edu.uw.ischool.{your NetID}"

and ProductName "HelloIOS"

Create a UILabel text

Edit to read "Go Seahawks!" or "Go Dawgs!" or "Cougars suck!"

Change the default font size and colors (purple background and white italic bold text, maybe?)

Put the label in the upper-left corner (to avoid size issues)

Homework: Steps
Target it to iOS iPhone 15 Pro (storyboard and execution target)

Ensure it builds correctly

Ensure it runs inside the emulator

Ensure it runs on an iOS device

Check it in to your GitHub account

Homework: Grading
All your code should be in a GitHub repo under your account

repo should be called 'helloios'

repo should contain all necessary build artifacts

create a directory called "screenshots", and store there:

screenshot of app running on emulator

pic or screenshot or movie of app running on a device

We will clone and build it from the GH repo

5 points:

it builds: 2 pts

it runs in the emulator: 1 pt

we see it runs on a device: 1 pt

the app name is "Hello": 1 pt

Homework: Rationale
The purpose of this homework is not really to challenge your programming skills

challenging your skills will come later

instead, we need to make sure your development machine of choice is all good to go

this is always a good exercise whenever you start a new language or project: make sure the infrastructure works

Do not, therefore, skimp this assignment!

it'll be tempting ...

... but you do NOT want to be wrestling with these problems during later assignments

Homework: Suggestions
Do a little bit of work, check in the work

get in to this habit now!

Try cloning the repository on a different machine and building

because that's how we'll be grading, so if you forgot to include something...

Change the displayed name of the app on the home screen to be "Hello"

you will need to Google this one

Hint: it's a setting in the project
